Step 1 - setup a new conda environment (assuming you have the base conda environment running) gnnpytorch_env by using the command -

conda env create -f gnnpytorch_env.yml

This will setup the basic dependencies you need to run the submission script, and may take 5-10 minutes. Following the create of this environment, switch to it using -

conda activate gnnpytorch_env

We still need to install some more dependencies, do this with the command -

pip install -r gnnpytorch_requirements.txt

Step 2 - (relevant to the judges only) replace graph_data.json with a desired JSON file containing networkx graphs. Currently, graph_data.json contains the first five molecules from the training data (with binding energy labels pruned).

Step 3 - run "python generate_results.py", will produce results.csv
